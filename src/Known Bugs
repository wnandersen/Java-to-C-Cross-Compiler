// Current known bugs //

~ Return Bug, translator will remove "()" in return statement "return ();" and completly omit omit return statement if "return;" is used (Java side) and leave semicolon.

~ Loop interputors: break, continue, return, do not translate at all.

~ Does not allow variables to be decalred on the same line, removes comas and places them all on the same line.

~ Left side incrementors and decrementors do not translate at all " ++x, --x ".

~ Array Bug, translator will add a copy of the contents in the square brackets on the next line if the array is declared and size is declared WITH other variables. "int [][] arr= new int [x][y]".

~ Type casting in general does not seem to translate in any way.
